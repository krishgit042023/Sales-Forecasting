**ðŸŽ¯ Sales Forecasting: Sticker Sales**

Predicting future sticker sales using advanced machine learning techniques.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project aims to accurately forecast sticker sales by analyzing historical sales data. By leveraging machine learning models, we identify trends, seasonality, and other contributing factors to predict future demand. The insights from this analysis can help optimize inventory, improve business strategies, and boost revenue.
